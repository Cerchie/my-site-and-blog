# Introduction

I read a good amount. Usually 40-80 books per year. I've been doing this since I could read! 
So if you're interested in reading more, or in where to find affordable books, this blog post is for you!

## Fueling your reading interest

### You don't have to finish every book.

Yup! Giving you permission right here to drop that book in the middle of it if you get bored. If you want to read a lot,
you've got to have internal motivation, and forcing yourself to finish a book that's boring to you,
 page by page, will take up your valuable reading time. You may not have much of it. 

 ### Go by authors.

 If you find a book you like, look up the author's other stuff! Read author interviews too. If they mention other authors,
 try them out. 

 ### Read for your own enjoyment, not to impress others.

 Seriously. No better recipe for boredom than trying to look cultured or intelligent.

 ### Judging a book by its cover is hit or miss.

 Weird I know. But about 80% of the time, when I pick a book by its cover, I enjoy it. 
 Of course, I've read hundreds of books that I loved that had very underwhelming covers. 

 ### You don't have to read a book. You can listen to it.

 A lot of people find reading very fatigueing for various reasons. That's what audiobooks are for! 

 ### Find the medium that works for you.

 See above, but also, this goes for digital vs physical. Some people are too distracted by their phones to 
 read on them, and need a Kindle or a physical book. Others have trouble keeping track of where their physical books are. 
 Some people are fine with both. Find what works for you.  

## Funding your reading interest

If each book that I read cost me an average of $20, that'd be $800-$1600 per year that I'd be spending! Yikes! 
So this is what I do instead:

### Libraries.

Public libraries are a great way to access books for free! See if you have one in your neighborhood. 
In the U.S., there are usually a couple features available that you should know about:

1. Interlibrary loan - what if you want a book your library doesn't have? You can request it through interlibrary loan, which basically means your library is borrowing it from another library.
2. Purchase request - sometimes the book will be too new for interlibrary loan. Often, you can request that your library purchase the book you want and put it on hold for you!
3. Library apps - think [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby) and [Hoopla](https://www.hoopladigital.com/). Check books out on your phone! 

### Used books.

#### thriftbooks.com

Use [Thriftbooks](https://www.thriftbooks.com/) to find cheap used books, especially if they might be rare. Careful, the rewards system is addicting. 

#### Used book sales

In my state, Arizona in the U.S., there's the annual [VNSA book sale](https://vnsabooksale.org/). Basically, it's a massive warehouse that gets stuffed with books that are sold at extremely cheap prices. People line up outside starting at 3 or 4am to be let in. Check if there's a similar sale near you via your city website. 

There's also usually a sale shelf at your local bookshop. 

### Little free libraries

Many neighborhoods use [little free libraries](https://littlefreelibrary.org/). Check the [map](https://littlefreelibrary.org/map/) to see if there's one in your neighborhood! Be sure to give back and donate books of your own.
